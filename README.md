# Reinforcement Learning 
Just a bunch of Python scripts implemented during my Master Thesis working on Reinforcement Learning using OpenAI Gym.

## Installation
We suggest to use **pipenv** to install all the packages needed to execute correctly the exercises.
```bash
git clone https://github.com/pieromacaluso/rl-exercises.git
cd rl-exercises
pipenv install
```
